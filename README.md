# Distributed Quantum Computing with Hybrid Secure Communication

This project demonstrates a simple quantum network using BB84 key exchange,
AES-GCM encryption, and a multi-node simulation of Grover's algorithm. It
provides a Tkinter GUI for running demos and visualizing results.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.10 or later.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running

```
python main.py
```

The GUI lets you exchange keys, send encrypted messages, and run Grover search.

## Testing

Run the unit tests with:

```
pytest
```
